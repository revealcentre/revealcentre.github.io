# REVEAL Website

Please follow the existing structure in the files:

For a new publication, create a new folder using the naming convention of the existing folders. It's easiset to copy one of the existing folders and then rename it and modify/overwrite the files so that it is consistent. Then add the thumbnail of the publication to research.html, as for the existing entries in that file. Publications should be listed there in chronological order, i.e. the newest come first.

For a new member, add a photo of the appropriate size to the /members folder (see the photos already in there), then modify about.html accordingly.

If you are unsure about anything, please ask Christof.
