<b>Abstract</b>:<br>
One of the big challenges today is to keep people healthy through sufficient exercise. In this project we developed a new method for improving exercise performance in a motivating manner using a VR exergame. Players can work out on an exercycle doing high-intensity interval training while wearing a VR headset and racing in a virtual world. Our method is an interactive adaptation of Feedforward, a type of training used to achieve rapid improvements by creating self models showing previously unachieved performance levels. The game lets players compete against themselves, making it a bit harder for them so they are able to surpass their own previous performance. Our method helped players perform better and also have a better experience compared to racing against a virtual competitor.
